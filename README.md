# midterm_project
Lighthouse labs midterm project - Data Science intensive Bootcamp

## Project/Goals
- The goal is to define clear problems and to solve it in a way that will benefit the business needs.
- Acquisition of data for the purpose of answering the problem questions - Data Acquisition Phase
- Perform data cleaning to prepare data for EDA and modeling.
- Carry out Explorative Data Analysis to identify pattern and abnormalities in the data.
- Selecting, developing, learning and generalizing a Machine Learning algorithm to solve problems.
- Model validation and summary using metrics and statsmodel libraries.

## Process
Step 1- Discuss logistics, data sources and potential datasets of interest.

Step 2- Understand the information in the data. identify and state problems to sets objectives and guides the project.

Step 3- Performed data reformatting, cleaning and wrangling for analysis and modeling.

Step 4- Performed EDA and build different visualizations to learn about the dataset.

Step 5- Features and target selection to split data into training and testing sets.

Step 6- Building model using Surpervised Learning Models.

Step 7- Testing, predicting, validating and providing explanation for the model summary.

Step 8- Discuss on solutions to the problems stated and challenges faced during the project.


## Results


Tableau Visualization and Dashboard
- Shows the attack types frequently use in terrorist attacks.
- shows the number of people killed per attack over the years.
- Shows the number of events and attack types per region.
- Shows people killed vs property value over time.
- Shows geographical map of number of people killed per country.
- Shows the number of suicide attacks per country.
- Shows targeted areas and number of casualties.

## Problem question
What are the determinant factors that result to the number of casualties in terrorist attacks?
With R-squared of 45%,the model indicates how much of the variation of a dependent variables is explained by an independent variable in a regression.
'extended'- How long the attack lasted.
'attacktype1_txt' - Weapon used for the attack.
'success'- Attacks mark as successfull or not.
'suicide' - Whether it was a suicide attack or not.
'nwound' - Number of people wounded in the attack.
'guncertain1' - Guns used in the attack.
'weaptype1_txt' - Types of weapon used in the attack.
'nkillter' - Number of terrorists killed in the attack.
'nwoundte'- Number of terrorists wounded in the attack.


## Challenges 
Although, the dataset provided alot of interesting features, but there were alot of missing values that limited the our ability to provide robust analysis and modeling.

## Future Goals
Future goals will be to carry out a business research that can provide detailed and better information on events related to global terrorism.
